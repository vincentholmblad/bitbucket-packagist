# About
A simple package that automatically creates an includable composer file with all repositories of a bitbucket user or team.

# Installation
`composer require vincentholmblad/bitbucket_packagist`

Add these lines to composer.json after you've installed the package.

```
// See https://bitbucket.org/account/user/<team or user>/api
// There you can create an OAuth consumer
// Make sure the consumer has access to read repositories
"config": {
    "bitbucket_consumer_key": "key",
    "bitbucket_consumer_secret": "secret",
    "bitbucket_team": "team or user"
},
// Merges scripts and repositories from the user or team
extra: {
    "merge-plugin": {
        "include": [
            "./vendor/vincentholmblad/bitbucket_packagist/bitbucket_packagist_base.json",
            "./bitbucket_packagist.json"
        ],
        "merge-scripts": true
    }
}
```

Then run `composer run-script bb_include_packages`.
